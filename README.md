## React E-Commerce
Personal Porfolio project, fully functioning, built with React, Redux and Firebase. Still expanding, next changes expected to add Hooks, integrate with Striper and add GraphQL api for product search.

## Features
User Login/Logout/Registration done with Firebase backend and Auth.
User uses the interface to choose from a list of categories of products he might want to buy. Once chosen it shows a list of products that can be purchased, price, and a cart. The application calculates total cost, shows cart summary and registers products in cache.

## Motivation
Ive built this project with the intention of putting to practice all the knowledge gathered while studying React/Redux. It has been helping me as well to learn even more about Hooks, Deployment, Firebase backend, etc.
The nice thing about developing an e-commerce is that is a quite usual project,that is required by many, but it also needs a lot of functionalities, many opportunities to learn then.

## Code style
Code written using Eslint Recommended for React:
